# TextAdventure_3.8
A new text adventure project with a heavier OOP focus.  The objective of this is to push every element into an object and minimizing the code written in the game (main) function.
I want this to project to be more like legos and less like a model.  I'm pushing to make this as modular as possible, with a heavy emphasis of designing with my own skillset.

# Current iteration's TODO list:
*pick up items
*inspect items
*use items

*monster character
*fight monster
*change character parameters based on monster fight

*give rooms their own uniqueness
*create loose storyline for game progression

# For Down the road:
*save functionality
*monsters stored and called from a table
